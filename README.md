## Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study

### Introduction:
I will follow the data analysis process which I learned from the course: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act to analyze the data.

Cyclistic is a bike-share company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations across the city. Customers can rent bikes from one station and return them to any other station within the network at their convenience.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has so far focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. They offer flexibile pricing plans single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Besides, it provides reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, effectively welcoming individuals with disabilities and those who can't ride on the standard two-wheeled bicycles. 
Based on the company database, Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. While traditional bikes remain as the popular option, around 8% of users opt for the assistive alternatives.

The company's marketing director believes that the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I have to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
